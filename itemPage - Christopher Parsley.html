                    Burbank’s native plants were once removed to make room for the new aesthetic of the imported
                    plants that were not suited for the hot climate. Ripping the plants out and replacing them with
                    vibrant green lawns that waste so much water, like that at Woodbury’s campus. Native Roots
                    starts to become an homage to the native plants, giving them a space to spread out their roots
                    and take over the space again. The monument works around two native trees on campus,
                    making use of the large shaded area that they create together. All of the plants that were
                    chosen for the monument are drought tolerant, and will become an effective way for the campus
                    to not be wasting as much water as it does now. Placing this monument in the quad not only
                    helps to conserve water, but allow for the space to be activated and let the public engage more
                    with the native plant life in Burbank.
