                    The internet has become the main outlet for services that go beyond in person
experiences. Social media has transformed the way we communicate, learn, and encounter life.
All of this to say that we no longer have the need to go out and seek social interaction or service
unless we choose to.
<br> <br>
In creating and designing this AR monument, I explored the roles of the landscape in a
physical public realm with goals of matching the excitement and exploration of the on-line 
world, relying heavily on creativity. The project, Form Follows Fun, inspired by the Burbank
Branch Railroad, invites people to explore the space around campus using the multi-functional
environment that still feels familiar whilst also sharing qualities of what was once the railroad.
The AR Monument serves as an interactive abstract art piece highlighting the life of the Burbank 
Branch Railroad and its impact on the community. The fun and creative setting allows for a
desirable space and true cultural experience
