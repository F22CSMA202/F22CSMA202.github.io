                    The narrative meaning of the Physical Monument Design is linked to Lockheed Aircraft Company (Lockheed Martin) and 
                    is related to many historical aviation moments during their time in Burbank, California.
                    Helix is a conceptual monument AR design idea, and it got inspired by a plane propeller. Helix monument intends to connect 
                    Aviation history to Burbank Woodbury University. The method idea is to incorporate a parasite with a combination of object 
                    sculptures; these will be an attachment between the Academic Affairs and Advancement buildings across the Alumni Quad. In 
                    addition, the intent is to have hanging letters that describe the negative and positive impacts of Lockheed 
                    and aviation from time to time during aircraft production in Burbank.
                    The intended material will incorporate steel members that support the helix form. Similarly, wings will be placed in the 
                    center to add staying in support to the whole structure. In addition, the setting will be attractive to contemplate the aluminum 
                    canvas letter attached to the ceiling.
