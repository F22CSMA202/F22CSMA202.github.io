                    Tongva Terra is a landscape architecture project that celebrates the Tongva people's rich
                    culture and community traditions. The project is designed to create a welcoming space for
                    visitors to learn about Tongva culture and history while enjoying the beauty of the natural
                    environment. For the Tongva people, the use of natural materials in their daily lives was not just
                    a practical consideration, but also a way to connect with the natural world and honor their
                    ancestors. By incorporating natural materials into landscape design based on Tongva traditions,
                    we can help to preserve and celebrate this rich cultural heritage. The projects planting palette is
                    selected to include native California plants. Overall, this project provides a central gathering
                    area for visitors to relax, socialize, and participate in community activities.
