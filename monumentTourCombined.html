                                Wildlife struggles to survive amidst the urbanization and destruction of their habitat. Some havelearned to adapt and live among us in these urbanized cities however, it is not of the best qualityof life. Their lives are at constant risk from being involved in vehicular accidents, poaching, andconstant poisoning of their habitats by humans. Those unable to live among us in our urbanizedcities, flee to areas that have yet to be taken over, usually mountains. Yet even in thesemountains, their quality of life is affected as well. Urbanization creates areas of isolatedwilderness islands, where natural habitats are surrounded by urban cities, trapping wildlife intovery limited land. Due to this, they are unable to leave without risking their lives, yet are limitedto resources. Here in Burbank, we have the Verdugo Mountains and close by are also theHollywood Hills. These two are examples of these wilderness islands that imprison wildlife in awall of cities. We must be more aware and considerate of our wildlife so that we can livealongside them, without hindering their survival
