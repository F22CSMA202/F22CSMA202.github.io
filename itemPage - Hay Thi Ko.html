                    The monument shows that Burbank has famous people along with the places that they 
                    had relationships with. Burbank has historic places where these popular people used, and the 
                    monument is to honor them with the spaces that they had relationships with by collecting the 
                    pieces that are related to these spaces. The purpose of the monument is to create a historic 
                    community with famous people and their spaces and giving information about how these 
                    monument pieces are related to the famous people along with their spaces. The foundation of the 
                    monument is Burbank city with the streets in Burbank since all the historic buildings and people 
                    were in Burbank. The idea of the monument is that the symbolizations of the buildings that 
                    popular people associated with are in the exact direction and location in Burbank City, creating 
                    the historic community, Landscape monument with the outline of the Burbank city.
