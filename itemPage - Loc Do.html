                    The 5WS monument is an innovative tribute to the six buildings on campus, addressing
                    the fundamental journalistic questions: who, what, when, where, and why. The monument
                    comprises a set of curved wooden structures that stand in front of each building, and its main
                    objective is to honor the person the building is named after and showcase their contributions to
                    the university.
                    The monument is designed as a pair of structures, with each pair representing a subtle
                    connection between the two buildings. While the pairs are not physically connected, their
                    placement is such that it implies a strong connection that symbolizes the roles and significance of
                    the individuals whose names are etched on the monuments.
                    Overall, the monument is a beautiful and innovative way to honor the people and their
                    contributions to the buildings on campus while informing the public about their significance to
                    Woodbury's history and legacy.
