                    Burbank has a rich, hidden history of winegrowing and making. The roots were helped 
developed by the various families who immigrated from Italy, departing to the states for new 
opportunity. These families (Brusso, Mcclure, Randisi, and Grangetto) all purchased their grapes 
from Ann Morra Frescuraâ€™s vineyard, which spanned over 70 acres throughout Burbank. 
<br> <br>
Pinot Pour is a commentary on the waste of gray-water in California, while also 
educating the audience on the process of winemaking. The experience starts by collecting water 
through a gutter system, and storing it. From here it is distributed to planters which will grow 
grapes on the above trellis. The trellis is placed above de-stemmers, which kick the winemaking 
process off, and connect to other machinery/steps through a downspout system. From here, destemmers feed into fermentation, which then feed into pressers to then be filtered, and finally 
stored for aging. All of the processes are annotated with their names in order to educate users 
during the experience.
