                    Burbank, California, is a city full of architectural richness and history.
                    There is much to explore, from the countless diverse houses to the four historical landmarks that
                    have been restored and preserved. ARtifacts offers an interactive journey into the culture, history,
                    and identity of the city. Visitors can take a walk or drive along the trail and discover twelve
                    remarkable homes. At the four protected historical landmarks, QR codes can be scanned to
                    unlock a unique household item from that specific architectural period through Augmented
                    Reality. These virtual ARtifacts feature animations, sound effects, and other engaging elements
                    that bring the history of the city to life. With this fun and educational approach, visitors can
                    explore the past and present architectural styles of Burbank and appreciate the intricate details
                    from different time periods.
