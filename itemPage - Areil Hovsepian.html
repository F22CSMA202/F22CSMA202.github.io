                    Eclectic Houses is a monument that carefully integrates elements from
                    twelve different residential architectural styles from Burbank, California. It presents the history
                    of the city's diverse architecture through a unified structure that showcases each style
                    chronologically, starting from the 1880s and progressing to the present day. A key feature from
                    each style is integrated to create an engaging and expressive spatial experience for users as they
                    view and move around the monument. Eclectic Houses will be situated at Woodbury University's
                    Alumni Quad and accessed through augmented reality, providing an open and accessible space
                    for visitors to interact with the monument. This project will be a source of pride and inspiration
                    for the community, bridging the gap between the city's past and present and offering a chance to
                    educate the public about the city's architectural richness.
