                    Branching out from Spanish Heritage, Creciente is a landscape monument that creates a space
that honors Latin and Hispanic students of Woodbury University. The augmented reality
monument has a path that leads the user into the monument where there are icons representing
Housing, Education, Community, Culture, and Health. When the user taps on these interactive
icons, they lead to different online resources that are aimed at helping and promoting Latin and
Hispanic people in Los Angeles. The colors of the monument are the six colors that are found
on every national flag in the Americas and are the unifying aspect of this space. The scattered
groupings of form are representative of smaller island nations that are physically removed but
nevertheless integral in the way Latin and Hispanic culture continues to grow.
