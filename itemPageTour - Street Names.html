                    Since Burbank has an interesting history filled with fascinating facts, there is a lot to learn about every part of the city. A street name's story is one of them. Burbank streets were never randomly named. They provide a great deal of insight into the city - its quirks, its people, and its hidden past. Some of the streets like Havard Road, Uclan Drive,etc. were named after famous universities because of the grand plans of a developer named Ben Marks. His goal was to create a “Greatest University in the World” which eventually became a pleasant residential neighborhood. It was called the Benmar Project, from the 1920s. Other streets were named after a famous event whether local, regional or national. A good example would be Victory Road. It was named after World War I; it was meant to honor the Valley boys who served in the war. Lastly, most of the streets were named after famous people that either were born or raised in the city. A prime example would be James Jeffries, a renowned boxer the used to live here in the city. <br> 
                    <br>

                    The purpose of this project is to inform users about the origins of Burbank Street Names. Through a QR code, users will be able to see 3 different locations in Burbank for their AR experience. A series of circular stickers will trigger the AR experience, which will be placed on various objects such as street signs, electric poles, fire hydrants, and traffic lights. Each street's AR experience will be unique based on its meaning. As an example, the AR experience for Jeffries Avenue will display James Jeffries. Once users click on his image, they will hear his voice playing in the background so that they will get a general understanding of who he was and his significance.
