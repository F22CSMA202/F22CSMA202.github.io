                "Mapping Burbank" is a unique digital platform that provides an immersive tour of the Burbank community. 
                Our mission is to bring to light the hidden stories and overlooked monuments of this city, which has long 
                been overshadowed by its reputation as a hub of the film and television industry. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Our team of Woodbury Students have worked together to create a self-guided, story-based tour that showcases 
                the rich history and cultural heritage of Burbank. Our platform combines cutting-edge technology with traditional 
                storytelling methods to create an engaging and informative experience for visitors.
