                <p class="sumText">
                    On the tour, the user becomes exposed to the history of the native Tongva tribe that lived
along the southern coastal lands of California. The Tongva were the second largest tribe on the
West Coast, they inhabited what is modern-day Los Angeles County and Orange County. In
Burbank, they lived along the LA River and amongst the Verdugo Mountains. They lived in
domed dwellings made of thatch and made tule canoes when traveling by water. The downfall
the Tongva's history and culture began with the colonization of the Spanish in California. The
Spanish took advantage of the Tongva’s humility to take over their land. <br>
<br>
The Tour consists of three locations. The first location takes the user to the bridge on
Cahuenga Blvd over the LA River. Here the user will be shown examples of Tongva’s lifestyle by
projecting a digital model of their Dwelling as well as the canoes they built. The second location
takes the user to Campo De Cahuenga, this site marks the arrival of the Spanish and their
involvement in destroying Tongva’s history. Here the user will see a projection of a drawing
depicting the Spanish missionaries interacting with the indigenous as well as hear audio of a
Tongva tribe member speaking on the Spanish impact on the indigenous. The third location of
the tour takes the user to Buena Vista Park, located along the LA River. Here they will be
interacting with the existing statue “Requiem” dedicated to the defenders of the constitution.
Here the user will project a reimagination of the existing statue that will be dedicated to the
Tongva Tribe as the first inhabitants of Burbank.
